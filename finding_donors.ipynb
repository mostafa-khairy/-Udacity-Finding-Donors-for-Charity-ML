    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "  - Logistic regression is much easier to implement than other methods, especially in the context of machine learning.\n",
    "  - Good accuracy for many simple data sets and it performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.\t\n",
    "  - It is quite easy to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train.\n",
    "  - It not only provides a measure of how appropriate a predictor is, but also its direction of the association.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "  - It constructs linear boundaries.\n",
    "  - Non-linear problems can’t be solved with logistic regression because it has a linear decision surface. Linearly separable data is rarely found in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "  - It is tough to obtain complex relationships using logistic regression. More powerful and compact algorithms such as Neural Networks can easily outperform this algorithm.\n",

    "  -  Predict estimated loss or profit while purchasing a particular stock  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "  -  Among all the available classification methods, random forests provide the highest accuracy. \n",
    "  -  The random forest technique can also handle big data with numerous variables running into thousands. It can automatically balance data sets when a class is more infrequent than other classes in the data\t\n",
    "  - Easy Data Preperation Overall no requirements for normalization or scaling makes Random Forests much more convenient than some other machine learning algorithms when it comes to \"data preperation and pre-processing\".\n",
    "  -  Suitable for large data If you have a large database or a huge dataset you need to work on, no worries. Usually, random forest algorithm handles large datasets pretty well.\n",
    "  - No Normalization Random Forests also don't require normalization\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "  - Overfitting Risk Although much lower than decision trees, overfitting is still a risk with random forests and something you should monitor\n",
    "  - Limited with Regression Random Forest regression is a thing, however, with so many regression model opportunities out there in data science world, random forests may not be the go-to regression approach in every application.\n",
    "  - Biased towards variables with more levels If your data has categorical variables with different levels of attributes this can be a big problem because random forest algorithm will favor those with more values which can pose a prediction risk.\n",
    "  - Optimization Options This can be a blessing and a curse depending on what you want.But random forest offers lots of parameters to tweak and improve your machine learning model.Just for computational efficiency, oob_score, n_estimators, random_state, warm_start and n_jobs are just a few that comes to mind.\n",

    "**Advantages**\n",
    "  - You can use it to solve multi-class prediction problems as it’s quite useful with them. \n",
    "  -  Naive Bayes classifier performs better than other models with less training data if the assumption of independence of features holds.   \t\n",
    "  - Easy Implementation Probably one of the simplest, easiest to implement and most straight-forward machine learning algorithm\n",
    "  - No Overfitting Naive Bayes' simplicity comes with another perk. Since it's not sensitive to noisy features that are irrelevant these won't be well represented in Naive Bayes Model. This also means that there is no risk of overfitting\n",
    "  -  Easy Training Naive Bayes is not a model to which you keep adding training data and it gets a whole lot better continuously.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "  - It assumes that all the features are independent. While it might sound great in theory, in real life, you’ll hardly find a set of independent features. \n",
    "  -  Limited Application Case As another side effect of all the other cons Naive Bayes comes with, the application case can be quite limited depending on your domain.\n",
    "  - Real World Problems Now, we mentioned Naive Bayes is fast and simple. Who doesn't like that? One problem is if you have data with features that are dependent of each other this might take away from Naive Bayes' prediction powers.\n",
    "  - No Regression Naive Bayes Classifier is strictly a classification algorithm and can't be used to predict continuous numerical value, hence no regression with Naive Bayes Classifier.\n",

    "  - Fast Prediction Support Vector Machines may be relatively sluggish when it comes to training especially with large datasets, however, when it comes to prediction they are quite fast. \t\n",
    "  -  Kernel Flexibility If you're a hands-on person who likes to learn and understand the intricacies of systems then you might actually enjoy the highly integrated kernel-world of Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "  -  Both Classification and Regression Skills SVMs can be used to both classify data and also predict continuous numerical values. Regression variance of Support Vector Machines are usually called SVR (Support Vector Regression)\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "  - Overfitting Risk Overfitting is another potential side effect of Support Vector Machines and it can be quite difficult to detect or fix at times.\n",
    "  -  Advanced Settings Although random forests have numerous optimization parameters too it's not so easy to make huge mistakes with them, but when it comes to Support Vector Machines, correct parameters can define the line between misery and victory.\n",
    "  - Suitable for Small Dataset Support Vector Machines don't have a scalable nature and they don't work that well with mid-size or large datasets.\n",
    "  - ow Interpretability Support Vector Machines don't provide very sophisticated and interpretable reports that can be interpreted in an easy fashion.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
